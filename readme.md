# [git auto][1] ![build status][2]
*an attempt to seemingly automate git project management*

## usage
in order for us to get started with git auto, we must simply install it (via
some not yet defined process) and run:

```
> git auto init
```

now we have git auto all setup! the only left to do is add tests which git
auto will use to automagically create releases on the master branch. first we
must create a script to act as our fake test:

####test_example.sh
```
#! bin/sh

echo "build successful"

exit 0
```

next we must register the test with git auto by creating a configuration file:

####git-auto.yaml
```
tests:
  build: ./test_example.sh
```

every time we commit git auto will run our tests and create a new release on
the master branch if they all exited successfully. it will also create a tag
for each test on the develop branch and update those tags to the last commit
each of them passed on. that way you know what commit started the failure of a
particular test.

git auto will only create a release if all tests pass on a single commit
(there are plans to make it configurable in the future).

now, let's test it out by making a commit on develop:

```
> touch readme.md
> git add readme.md
> git commit -m "add readme"
> git auto test run
build successful

1 tests passed, 0 tests failed
updating test tags:
  build -> ac56f0b
incrementing release to 0.0.1:
  develop -> master
```

and we've just successfully used git auto! \\(:D)/ ..but there's much more to
git auto than that. i would suggest you check out the documentation to
discover the true power of git auto. until next time..
