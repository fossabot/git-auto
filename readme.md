[git auto][1] [![build status][2]][3] [![gitter][4]][5] [![waffle][6]][7]
=============
_an attempt to seemingly automate git project management._

usage
-----
first, 
  you must install it (not working yet):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mraxilus/git-auto.git git-auto
./git-auto/install.sh
```

next,
  you should create a new directory,
  and initialise it as a git auto repository:

```
mkdir hello_git_auto
cd hello_git_auto
git auto init
```

now you have git auto all setup!
the only left to do is add tests. 
git auto will use them to automagically create releases on the release branch.
in order to do this you must create a script to act as your test:

```sh
echo "\
#! bin/sh

exit 0
" > example_test.sh
```

ignoring the fact that the test always passes,
next you must register it with git auto by modifying the configuration file:

```sh
echo "\
tests:
  example: ./example_test.sh
" > git-auto.yml
```

every time we make a commit git auto will run our test.
it will also create a new release on the release branch if the tests exited successfully.
in addition,
  it will also create a tag for each test,
  and update those tags to the last commit with which they passed individually.
that way you know which commit started the failure of a particular set of tests.
git auto will only create a release if all tests pass on the latest commit.

now,
  let's test it out by making a commit:

```sh
chmod +x example_test.sh
git add example_test.sh git-auto.yml
git commit --message="add example test"
```

and we've just successfully used git auto!
\\(:D)/ ...but there's much more to git auto than that.
i would suggest you check out the documentation to discover the true power of git auto.
until next time...

purpose
-------
the idea of [git flow][8] is lovable,
  however using it properly doesn't fit with the mantra of ultimate laziness.
and thus,
  git auto was born!
